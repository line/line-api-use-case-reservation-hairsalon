# Overview

This is the demo app source code for the [Hair Salon Reservation](https://lineapiusecase.com/en/usecase/reservation.html) provided on the [LINE API Use Case site](https://lineapiusecase.com/en/top.html). By referring to the steps described in this article, you can develop a hair salon reservation app using the LINE API. The hair salon reservation app is launched on the LIFF browser in the LINE app, and you can make a reservation at the hair salon. To prevent users from forgetting to visit the store, you can implement a reminder function via a LINE message by default.

The source code environment introduced on this page uses AWS.

*Documentation and other content are only available in Japanese.

# Libraries

## Node.js

Install Node.js, which will be used for the front-end development, in your local development environment.

*We recommend installing the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version (v10.13 or later).

- [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Python

Install Python version 3.8 or later if it isn't already installed.

You can check if it's installed by entering this command in Command Prompt or Terminal:

```
python --version
```

If Python is installed, the version will be returned. For example:

```
Python 3.8.3
```

Install Python (3.8 or higher), used for backend development, in your local development environment if it's not already installed.

Python installation reference site:

Windows: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html
Mac: https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html

## AWS SAM

The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is used to deploy this app.
